# Superjoin Hiring Assignment

### Welcome to Superjoin's hiring assignment! üöÄ

### Objective
Build a solution that enables real-time synchronization of data between a Google Sheet and a specified database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). The solution should detect changes in the Google Sheet and update the database accordingly, and vice versa.

### Problem Statement
Many businesses use Google Sheets for collaborative data management and databases for more robust and scalable data storage. However, keeping the data synchronised between Google Sheets and databases is often a manual and error-prone process. Your task is to develop a solution that automates this synchronisation, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other in real-time.

### Requirements:
1. Real-time Synchronisation
  - Implement a system that detects changes in Google Sheets and updates the database accordingly.
   - Similarly, detect changes in the database and update the Google Sheet.
  2.	CRUD Operations
   - Ensure the system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both Google Sheets and the database.
   - Maintain data consistency across both platforms.
   
### Optional Challenges (This is not mandatory):
1. Conflict Handling
- Develop a strategy to handle conflicts that may arise when changes are made simultaneously in both Google Sheets and the database.
- Provide options for conflict resolution (e.g., last write wins, user-defined rules).
    
2. Scalability: 	
- Ensure the solution can handle large datasets and high-frequency updates without performance degradation.
- Optimize for scalability and efficiency.

## Developer's Section

### My Approach

- I started off by analysing the problem statement and coming up with a high level view in order to understand what I should be doing and how I should be approaching this problem

![High Level View/Flowchart of the approach](./flowchart.png)

- Since I am most comfortable with Python and MySQL, I chose to use these in building this solution.
  
- **Libraries Used**:

```
  - Flask
  - google.oauth2.credentials
  - google_auth_oauthlib.flow
  - googleapiclient.discovery
  - google.auth.transport.requests
  - mysql.connector
  - os
  - time
  - re
  - threading
```

- **Features**:
  
  **1. Google Sheets to MySQL Synchronization:**

  - Listens to incoming webhooks from Google Sheets. When a change is detected in the Google Sheet, the application updates the corresponding MySQL table.
  - For now it only supports predefined column mappings between Google Sheets columns and MySQL table columns.
  - Handles all CRUD functionality from Google Sheets to MySQL.

  **2. MySQL to Google Sheets Synchronization**
  
  - Periodically polls the MySQL database for changes using a background thread.
  - Detects insert, update, and delete operations from the updates table in MySQL.
  - Reflects changes in the MySQL database to Google Sheets by appending new rows, updating existing rows, or clearing rows based on the detected operation.
  - Ensures that all changes made in MySQL are synchronized to Google Sheets, keeping both data sources up-to-date.

- To expose the Flask server so that it could be accessed by the Apps Script code, I used ngrok:

  ``` sh
  ngrok http 5000
  ```

  The downside of this is that if for any reason I need to run ngrok multiple times to expose the server, then the URL that is in the Apps Script code must be modified

- I started off by trying to immediately dynamically handle all changes which did not work as expected. Hence, I switched to focusing on making synchronization in one direction work properly, albeit with restrictions - We have a fixed schema both on the Google Sheets and the MySQL end.

- To handle sync from MySQL to Google Sheets, I created triggers that would run after an insert/update and before a delete. The triggers push to a secondary table called Updates where we use the most recent query in case of multiple entries for the same PersonID. The polling mechanism runs on a separate thread and checks the updates table every 5 seconds (although this frequency can be adjusted) to see if there are changes.
- If there are any changes, they are executed and the updates table is cleared.

- To dynamically handle any changes to the sheet this is what I planned to implement:

  - Each sheet in a Google Sheet corresponds to a table in the database
  - Adding a sheet leads to adding a table. Renaming a sheet renames the table
  - Adding columns adds columns in the table and renaming them renames in the table.
  - To identify column headers, I plan to use regex to check if the cell number of the value most recently changed has a 1 in it - this tells us that it is a column header
  - Likewise any edits/insertions in the sheet will merit the same in the database.
  - Using regex and ord(), we figure out which column had a value changed, then we run a DESC \<Table Name>; to understand the structure of the table and use it to craft our query such that the correct record is updated.

#### Additional Thoughts

Some edge cases that I thought of include:

- Merging of cells in the Google Sheet
- Applying filters and such in the Google Sheet
- Charts and other graphics that would modify cell contents and thereby trigger the webhook
- Tables and Pivot Tables in the Google Sheet would possibly need to be represented in the database
- While primary keys having unique values can be and is enforced in the database, the same is not mandated in Google Sheets. In other words, what is the primary key in the database can have duplicate entries in the Google Sheet. The question arises here, which record do you consider as the valid one?

#### Improvements

- Right now, the solution does not work as it should. The major problem I have identified in this regard is that syncing changes from Google Sheets to MySQL results in the triggers being triggered which can cause redundant data in the Google Sheets. To solve this, I think adding an extra column to the persons table that flags whether a change should be added to update or not is one approach. Another less elegant approach would be to disable triggers when syncing from sheets.
- As of now, there is no front end view for users to interact with, making the solution not very appealling, visually. To this end, I can further utilise the capabilities of Flask and setup a frontend for users to interact with and to provide a simplified view of the SQL table.
- Utilising a message queue/broker might be a more elegant alternative to solving the issue of syncing from the database to Google Sheets. Since I'm not very experienced with that and we were short on time, I abstained from this solution.
